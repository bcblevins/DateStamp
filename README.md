# Date Stamp

Date Stamp is a browser extension developed for Companion Animal Hospital of Wakefield to add functionality to the record keeping system used there.

## This is a browser extension that has 2 stamp tools available to anyone

1. Time Stamp: Inserts time stamp at the cursor
2. Pending Stamp: Inserts "PENDING month/day" at the beginning of a text field. If this stamp is already present, selecting this option will update the date.

## Deeper functionality available to those at Companion Animal Hospital of Wakefield

1. Communication Highlighting: searches the active page for communication records and injects styling to highlight them based on their status. Records with "PENDING" at the beginning are highlighted blue, and "UPDATED" are highlighted in yellow.
2. "In Progress" Stamp: finds the user's initials on the page and creates a stamp of "'initials' in progress" and adds it to the beginning of the active text field if one isn't already there. If an "in progress" stamp is already present, selecting this option will remove it.
